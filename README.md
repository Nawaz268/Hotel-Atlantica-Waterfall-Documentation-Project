# Hotel-Atlantica-Waterfall-Documentation-Project

In this project, a team of students from Saint Mary's University, Halifax compiled the documentation required for a hotel owner of a hotel named 'Hotel Atlantica'. The students are part of the Masters of Science (Computing and Data Analytics) course and wrote all the documents as a real-life scenrio. The documentations are written in the context from the beginning of the SDLC as a waterfall model. The documentation begins with the system requirement and ends with test cases.
